 <p>I've been neglecting Tinderbox this week, which is a mistake since I'm participating in the <a href="https://forum.eastgate.com/t/tinderbox-meetup-saturday-24-feb-2024-blogging-and-weblogging-with-tinderbox/" title="Tinderbox Meetup Saturday 24 Feb. 2024: Blogging and Weblogging with Tinderbox - Tinderbox &amp; Storyspace Events - Tinderbox Forum">Blogging with Tinderbox meetup</a> on Saturday. I'll be leaning on <a href="https://nice-marmot.net/" title="Main Page">Dave</a> for the meat of the thing, since he's been putting a lot of thought into the topic recently. I've gotten this Tinderbox file to the point where I don't need to think about it much, so I haven't. My thoughts have been more around which tool to use for blogging, which sometimes means Tinderbox and sometimes doesn't. Should be interesting.</p>

<div class="note text">



 <p>I used to love databases. I put everything in them. I've used SQL Server, Postgres, Oracle, Access, MySQL, etc. Loved them. But now, for some reason, I avoid them and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because of my infatuation with plain text and associated tooling. Maybe it's fear of "lock-in". Just an observation. I wonder how limiting this is in what I decide to build.</p>

 <p>Just for fun, I recently put up a sort of landing page at <a href="https://jackbaty.com">jackbaty.com</a>. It's just an org-mode file exported as HTML with the most basic CSS I could muster that also makes the page readable. I plan to keep a page like this around, but I'm thinking about moving it from jackbaty.com to jack.baty.net. I've been slowly moving from a bunch of custom domains to putting everything under subdomains of <a href="https://baty.net">baty.net</a>. I need at least one totally static site under which I can drop documents and files that isn't controlled by a CMS of any kind. I have <a href="https://static.baty.net">static.baty.net</a> now, so maybe some version of that would work? Still noodling on it.</p>

 <p>I recently wrote about my <a href="https://baty.net/journal/2024/02/16/flickr-subscription-decision" title="Jack Baty | Flickr subscription decision">upcoming Flickr subscription</a> and whether I would renew after 20 years. I find <a href="https://glass.photo/jbaty" title="Jack Baty on Glass Photography Community">Glass.photo</a> to be a better visual experience and the conversations there are more frequent and of higher quality. But really they are two different things for me. Glass is where I showcase my photography and Flickr is where I share my photos. The difference is subtle, but meaningful, which is why I'll probably keep both. I'm reminded of PetaPixel's recent post: <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/08/07/10-reasons-why-flickr-is-the-best-site-on-the-internet-for-photographers/">10 Reasons Why Flickr is the Best Site on the Internet for Photographers</a>.</p>

<div class="note text">



 <p>Why do I feel an obligation to software? There are apps that I've used for quite a long time and for some reason I feel obligated to continue using them. <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox" title="Eastgate: serious hypertext ">Tinderbox</a>, <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="GNU Emacs - GNU Project">Emacs</a> are good examples. They're all great, but I rarely need the power afforded me and it's not always worth the added complexity. But I tinker, you know. They are part of my muscle memory. I have many (many!) documents that I created using each of them. I suspect that maybe I feel this way because they're also part of my identity. I've written about them often. I could simply stop using any of them and who would care? No one, probably, but since I can't seem to shut up about anything I would still feel guilty, somehow.</p>

 <p>I'm still not working, meaning I have a lot of time my hands. Having so much time offers me the opportunity to sit and stare at things and over-think everything about them. Where should I document the fact that I upgraded Sonoma on the MBP to 14.3.1 this morning? The correct answer is, "Who gives a shit?!". Spending hours and hours figuring out how and where to document all the minutiae in my life is an unnecessary and life-wasting routine. I need to go out and do interesting and meaningful things so that I no longer have the time nor inclination to document everything all the time.</p>

<p>They pack a ton of useful info into a tiny space. They show whether a note contains text, how much, and if there are inbound or outbound links. They also "yellow" with age, so I can see at a glance which are new and which are old. It's subtle, clever, and very useful.</p>

 <p>I am sitting on the fence between plain text and GUI-licious tools. I'm typing this in <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> and spending lots of time in my Daybook.tbx file. I've reacquainted myself with <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> and have even fired up the new version of <a href="https://zengobi.com/curio/">Curio</a>. On the other hand, I remain deep into Emacs, but have also been using <a href="https://mutt.org">Mutt</a> for email and <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a> for tasks and now I'm infatuated with <a href="https://xwmx.github.io/nb/">nb</a>. So you can see my dilemma. I love so many things about all of them that I never want to give any of them up completely. So I continue to scatter my stuff among a dozen apps and end up frustrated.

	<img src="/img/small/tinderboxicon.png" alt="Speeding up Tinderbox rendering times" class="sideImage">


 <p>This blog takes about 20 seconds to fully render out of Tinderbox. That's not long, but it's too long, especially while I'm composing a post and want to see what it's going to look like 75 times before I publish it ðŸ˜†. I tend to type->render->edit->re-render->repeat so saving a few seconds each time is worth the trouble.</p>
 <p>It occurred<a href="https://nice-marmot.net/"> to me afte</a>r chatting with Dave Rogers yesterday that most of the content only needs publishing after global template updates. There are only a handful of documents that change with each post, e.g. the home page, the post itself, and the archives page. </p>
<p>I created a stamp that toggles the $HTMLDontExport and $HTMLExportChildren flags so that only relevant content is rendered when exporting. I have a container of aliases that list the outline items that don't need to be exported each time and I toggle those off during the draft phase. Then I toggle them on for a final export before pushing the changes live.</p>
<p>I could probably create some sort of fancy action code that would know what to do. Maybe I will, but for now this does what I need.</p>
<p>The export now takes under two seconds. (It's the /archives.html page that's the killer, so I wait until the last minute to render that one). Show me another blogging tool that makes something like this so easy.</p>

 <p>My earlier post, <a href="posts/2024/02/09/It-s-the-tools-Or-is-it.html">It's the tools. Or is it?</a>, reminded me what it is that draws me to certain software.

All three of these are (mostly) self-contained systems within which one can take notes, manipulate them, and generate output using built-in facilities. Tinderbox is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">Quine</a>, exactly, but it allows me to collect, write, and do all kinds of fancy things with text. Same with TiddlyWiki and Emacs. Their approaches are different, but it's a common thread that draws me to them.</p>

 <p>Dave Rogers posted earlier about <a href="https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/February_2024.html#note_1785">Blogging with Tinderbox</a>. His thoughts mostly echo my own. In it, he says that I am more "a 'tool is the object' kind of guy". I cringed for a moment at this, but he's absolutely right. I <i>want</i> to be a person who simply chooses the correct tool for the thing that they want to make, but I'm not that person. I sometimes don't make anything at all until I find some new tool to make it with. Sure, that's probably backwards and wrong, but I can't help it. I love trying software, cameras, pens, and devices of all kinds. Studying how they solve problems is fun for me.</p>
<p>I have a long history of finding new ways of making words appear on the internet. I've used so many tools for so many things that I feel I have a pretty broad perspective of what's available.</p>
<p>Blogging tools are everywhere. It's a mature category, yet new ones show up all the time. If you don't like one of them, find another. Goodness knows I've done plenty of that ðŸ˜€. </p>
<p>I don't know if anyone would put <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> on their short list of blogging tools. That's a shame, really, because it fills a niche but useful category. I'm not even sure how to define it. Dave's post lists a few reasons one might use Tinderbox for blogging, but for me it's that Tinderbox is the single most useful and flexible Mac app I've ever used. For a long time, I used it for <i>everything</i>, including my blog. </p>
<p>A brief foray into Linux and the discovery of Emacs and Org-mode pulled me away from using Tinderbox for everything, but there's nothing like its combination of Map, Hyperbolic, and Timeline views of the same information, so I still use it for certain things. Every time I launch Tinderbox I'm reminded that it can do just about anything, including creating a nice blog.</p>
<p>When I'm in an Emacs mood, it sucks up all my attention. Once you're all-in with Emacs, it's difficult to use anything else. So I'll move by blog to Hugo or Kirby or some other blogging platform that uses plain text files.</p>
<p>After a while, text file fatigue sets in and I do something like fire up a WordPress instance. That's gross, so then I'll launch my Blog.tbx file and remember how damn good Tinderbox is at everything, including generating a static website/blog. So I start typing, like I'm doing right now.</p>
<p>I don't even know what I came here to say, honestly. Probably that tools are important to me, and Tinderbox is a good one.</p>

 <p>Here's the thing, the best way to build a website is to publish static HTML files. If you want it to be fast, secure, and long-lasting. This blog is rendered as HTML files by Tinderbox. Once they're out there, they stay there. The only dependency being a simple web server. Any web server. It's pretty great.</p>
