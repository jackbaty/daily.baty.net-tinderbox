	<p>There's quite a kerfuffle on Bluesky around the fact that they weren't preventing the creation of inappropriate usernames. Someone of course did just that, and all hell broke loose. The small team at Bluesky running the beta (it's a beta, remember) removed the account almost immediately and implemented a fix. Then, if I understand it correctly, needed to improve the fix. </p>
<p>The team went silent for a day or two while I'm sure they were scrambling to figure out what to do. Then hell got worse.</p>
<p>There have been increasingly aggressive calls for an apology. People are losing their shit because the Bluesky team hasn't self-flagellated nearly hard enough. I can't imagine an apology that would satisfy them at this point.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, most of the loudest complainers would be completely unaffected by the problem in the first place, but pile on they have.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are things the Bluesky team should have done better. I just don't like the default mode of "That's Bad!!!"  so many people seem to be stuck in. I don't know what's going on over there, but neither does anyone else. Maybe the Bluesky team really is a bunch of racist idiots, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I have no dog in this fight, so all this is just the result of me feeling disappointed in the uncharitable stance taken by so many about so many things.</p>
