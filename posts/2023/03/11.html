 <p>Ten years ago, Steven Johnson wrote <a
href="%5Bhttps://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58%5D(https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58)">The
Spark File</a>, in which he describes his process for keeping track of
hunches, ideas, etc. in a single text file.</p>
<p>I, of course, thought this was a great idea and immediately started
keeping my own spark file. It began in 2012 and I was reasonably
consistent with it until 2016. After that, there was a lull, but it
picked up a again for a short time in 2021, after which I sort of forgot
about it.</p>
<p>I ran into the file today and reviewing it has been quite a trip. The
short version is that I’ve only done a few of the things I’d written
down. This is fine, since many of them are things I’m either no longer
interested in or were too ambitious anyway. I have, since I last
checked, completed a few of them. Crossing them off the list was fun.
There are others that are still good ideas and that I may pursue.</p>
<p>Since the file is an org-mode file, I’ve added a capture template to
my Emacs config that lets me quickly capture new entries. Now I just
need some hunches or ideas to capture.</p>

 <p>I’m experimenting with using Markdown as markup for my Tinderbox
posts. Tinderbox has some support for Markdown, even though the note
editor is always using rich text “in the background”. The trick is to
create a prototype based on the built-in Markdown prototype and make a
few tweaks specific to the way I work. For example, my prototype uses a
monospaced font and <a
href="%5Bhttps://pandoc.org/%5D(https://pandoc.org/)">pandoc</a> for
rendering. This post is the first to attempt it. Just for fun, let’s add
an image using Markdown formatting<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/2023/20230311-Roll-103_14.jpg"
alt="Alice. (Leica MP/HP5)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Alice. (Leica MP/HP5)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A nice side effect of using Pandoc is that images like the above are
automatically rendered as figure elements, with a figcaption generated
from the Alt text. It’s handy.</p>

 <p>Each new day I reset everything and begin again, from scratch. At
least that’s what it feels like. I throw away the things I learned
yesterday and try something else. Can you imagine how far along I’d be
today if I hadn’t been doing that all this time?</p>
<p>For example, I’m writing this post in Tinderbox because this morning
that’s where I feel like writing blog posts. Yesterday, I felt like
using Drummer for a while, then I was back to Emacs for the
afternoon.</p>
<p>I also spent hours yesterday learning some new Tinderbox tricks. I’ve
been using Tinderbox on and off for like 15 years now. What if there
were no “off” periods? Can you imagine how good at it I would be? I’d be
holding classes.</p>
<p>It’s the same with Emacs. I’m going on, what, 10 years in Emacs?
You’d think I’d be good at it. I’m not, because I keep trying to quit
using it for some reason. Why? Because maybe Obsidian would work better
for me?</p>
<p>Last week, I would have hand-written this post first in my notebook.
The week before that, on a typewriter. Or maybe the iPad.</p>
<p>Every time I reset and say, “<em>THIS</em> is how I’m doing it from
now on!” I lose hours or days of progress. I don’t know how to stop.</p>
