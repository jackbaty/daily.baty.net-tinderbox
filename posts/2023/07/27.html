 <p>My original <a href="https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977760853">Ember mug</a> died last year and I've been dragging my feet on paying for another one. My thoughtful wife bought me a new one for my birthday. She's the best. I love having hot coffee again without having to drink out of an insulated Yeti or whatever.</p>

 <p>There's a thread going on over on Micro.blog that I have thoughts on. Some argumentative, some contrarian, some agreeable. I just don't want to talk about social media anymore, so this is all you get.</p>

 <p>A few weeks ago I ditched my Doom Emacs config and built my own from scratch. I used <a href="https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs">NANO Emacs</a> as inspiration. It's been slow going but it's been working pretty well. I've gotten things to a point where I am comfortable with how it all works. Finally, right?</p>
<p>Then suddenly Emacs started crashing every time I launched it. I needed to relaunch a few times before it didn't crash. I could not tie this to any specific change. </p>
<p>Then, exporting PDFs started looking a bit off and I noticed that paragraphs were indenting again, even though I'd been using the same Pandoc template for years. WTF?</p>
<p>I realized I hadn't installed and configured Auctex/LaTeX so maybe that was the culprit. It took me an hour to figure out how to install Auctex using straight.el but I finally managed to get it working. Of course that didn't fix the paragraph problem. I had to go back to using my old built-in org version of the exporter rather than Pandoc, which I'd standardized on last year. And I barely remember how any of that works. LaTeX can be a drag.</p>
<p>I'm still not working, so none of this was time-sensitive or even that important. But what if it was?  What if I was in the middle of a work crisis and I had to say, "Hang on, my editor is acting up again." I realize that the intersection of work emergency and Emacs troubles is pretty narrow, perhaps even imaginary, but it has me thinking about the complexity and resiliency of my tools.</p>
