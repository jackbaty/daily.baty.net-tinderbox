 <p>I've had an iPad since 2010 and I've still never used one for anything other than trivial tasks. I just can't. And yet, I continue to temper my workflow around "but what if I need this on my iPad?" It's silly. I'd be better off getting rid of the thing so I could stop wringing my hands about how I'm going to use it one day. I'm not.</p>

 <p>I've been a little twitchy about sharing <i>everything</i> I post here over to my <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">Micro.blog feed</a>. I sometimes say things here that I don't want to "go anywhere".  Not everything I say is a prompt for comments or discussion. Sometimes I'm simply getting things off my chest, you know?</p>
<p>To solve this, I've added an attribute in Tinderbox called "IncludeInRSS". This is a checkbox and it defaults to true. If I want to keep a post out of the RSS feed, I just uncheck the box. This meant updating a few agent queries in Tinderbox, but only took about 10 minutes to implement.</p>

 <p>There's quite a kerfuffle on Bluesky around the fact that they weren't preventing the creation of inappropriate usernames. Someone of course did just that, and all hell broke loose. The small team at Bluesky running the beta (it's a beta, remember) removed the account almost immediately and implemented a fix. Then, if I understand it correctly, needed to improve the fix. </p>
<p>The team went silent for a day or two while I'm sure they were scrambling to figure out what to do. Then hell got worse.</p>
<p>There have been increasingly aggressive calls for an apology. People are losing their shit because the Bluesky team hasn't self-flagellated nearly hard enough. I can't imagine an apology that would satisfy them at this point.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, most of the loudest complainers would be completely unaffected by the problem in the first place, but pile on they have.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are things the Bluesky team should have done better. I just don't like the default mode of "That's Bad!!!"  so many people seem to be stuck in. I don't know what's going on over there, but neither does anyone else. Maybe the Bluesky team really is a bunch of racist idiots, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I have no dog in this fight, so all this is just the result of me feeling disappointed in the uncharitable stance taken by so many about so many things.</p>
