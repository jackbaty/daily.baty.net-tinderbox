 <p>Good morning. It's 4:55 am and I've walked a mile, done a short Apple Fitness "strength" workout, and meditated for 15 minutes. In other words, I did what I'm supposed to do every morning, but don't.</p>

 <p>I'm definitely experiencing Tinderbox Fatigue this morning. Some days I just want to type and post and not wonder why I lost all my tags or what I did to break my RSS feed.</p>

<div class="note text">



 <p>There is an ongoing conflict between my love of trying new blogging/publishing tools and the idea of having One True Blog™. The first is for me and the second is for readers.</p>
<p>I had a thought this morning. What if I could aggregate all of my sites into a single RSS feed? There are a few approaches to this, but what I've decided to try is cross-posting everything to <a href="https://copingmechanism.com">Coping Mechanism</a>. The idea is that Coping Mechanism would grab the posts from my other sites and combine them into one giant blog whose RSS feed encapsulates everything.</p>
<p>I'm testing this with a couple of WordPress plugins: <a href="https://www.wprssaggregator.com">WP RSS Aggregator</a> and its <a href="https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/feed-to-post/">Feed to Post</a> add-on.</p>
<p>I'll let you know if it works. If it does, those of you with an interest in following my various experiments will have a handy, single RSS feed to subscribe to. Meanwhile, I can continue writing all over the place.</p>

 <p>Ok, so after implementing my new idea of consolidating posts via RSS over at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>, I've decided that this blog can once again live at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. This leaves my old Ghost blog still purring over at baty.blog. I'll just add the feeds to Coping Mechanism and y'all can just "consume" everything there. Or, if you prefer, just follow whichever individual site you like. Weird? Maybe. I wish I'd have thought of this yesterday before mucking about with everything.</p>

 <p>I see that Dave Winer has a small financial stake in <a href="https://logseq.com">Logseq</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I have to make a disclosure that I wish I had been able to make in November. I have made a small investment in the company. They have not announced this yet, and they asked me to wait until they do, but I feel I've already waited too long. I need people to know that I have a financial interest in the success of the company.</p>

<p>It's cool seeing interop happening, but it doesn't seem like disclosing early jibes with his earlier statement that, "Fourth, I like the team!"</p>
